    With other recent publicized advances in technology such as virtual reality, self-driving vehicles, and artificial intelligence it’s possible that these new updates could become part of instant messaging. For instance, instant messaging may be more personalized with virtual interface that allows the user to see more of what their contact is seeing or virtually be in multiple places at once, sharing the experience of riding in a self-driving vehicle with a contact, calls while driving, or even artificial connections which are known to exist in the form of bots with various capabilities to help assist in the user’s experience.
    	One current area of IM that will likely see many improvements and developments in the future is security. Currently, a secure method of IM exists, called End-to-End encryption. With E2EE, only the recipient has the key needed to decrypt and encryption is done by the client. Neither network servers nor hackers of the server will have access to the message, and the server will also not be able to hand over recorded conversations to law enforcement because it won’t have been able to record them. The main protocol for IM encryption is the Signal Protocol developed for an app called Signal by Open Whisper Systems (Advanced). In the future, as concerns over privacy get more important to users of IM applications it is likely that encryption with become more effective and that new methods will be introduced. For example, steganography attempts to hide the presence of information as opposed to making it unreadable like in cryptography. This could potentially include the effective encoding of information into metadata that is sent between clients.
    Despite these developments, Instant Messaging has critiqued for its societal effects. For instance, it may detract from workplace environments. Business Productivity (2011) concluded from a study by Schwarz that “32% of the individuals who used instant messaging in the office acknowledged that instant messaging could encourage workplace gossip, and 29% noted that instant messaging had been a distraction at some point in the past” (para. 9). Another concern, according to Business Productivity (2011) is related to a  decline in person relationships. Additionally, it may contribute to  rises in multitasking and grammatical issues within schools according to O’Connor as cited by UK Essays (2013, para. 4). On the flipside, IM technology has many benefits to society It is seen as helpful for saving time and money (Business Productivity, 2011; Hutt, 2017; Scott, n.d.). In addition to these social behavioral changes, laws have shifted to accommodate changes in communication. Within the United States, there are policies concerning IM that state “agencies that allow IM traffic on their networks must recognize that such content may be a Federal record” (The U.S. National Archives Records Administration, Does My IM Content Qualify as a Federal Record?, para. 1, 2016). This means that law enforcement may be able to access any data collected by IM companies. In additional, company specific policies give IM servers access to user information; there are greater data collection opportunities. This has possibly led to the increase in research in the disciplines such as Data Science and Media Studies. Furthermore, IM has been known to reach fields such as health care where doctor may transmit personal information of clients. Given the scope of IM, it makes sense that there has been pushes for increased security and openness from IM servicing companies about data breaches, (Chair & Gane, 2018).
