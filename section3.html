  </div>
  <p>
    All IM networks have a basic functionality, but what developments will occur to the technology in the future? There have been other recent advances in technology such as virtual reality, self-driving vehicles, and artificial intelligence. Perhaps these new updates will be incorporated into instant messaging in some way. For instance, instant messaging may be further personalized with virtual interfaces that allows the user to see more of what their contact is seeing. Or perhaps IM would allow a use to virtually be in multiple places at once, sharing the experience of riding in a self-driving vehicle with a contact by calling while being driven. As for artificial intellegence, these intelligent networks or bots could be used to personalize the user's experience on an IM client based on their previously indicated preferences. These applications might seen far off now, but they are potential applications of IM in the future.</p>
    <p>
    Additionally, one current area of IM that will likely see many improvements and developments in the future is security. Currently, a secure method of IM exists, called End-to-End encryption. With E2EE, only the recipient has the key needed to decrypt and encryption is done by the client. Neither network servers nor hackers of the server will have access to the message, and the server will also not be able to hand over recorded conversations to law enforcement because it won't have been able to record them. The main protocol for IM encryption is the Signal Protocol developed for an app called Signal by Open Whisper Systems (<a href=resources.html#Ad>Advanced</a>). </p>
    <p>In the future, as concerns over privacy get more important to users of IM applications, it is likely that encryption will become more effective and that new methods will be introduced. For example, steganography attempts to hide the presence of information as opposed to making it unreadable like in cryptography. This could potentially include the effective encoding of information into metadata that is sent between clients.
    </p> <p>
    Despite it's developments and future potential, IM is critiqued for its negative societal effects. For instance, it may detract from workplace environments. <a href=resources.html#business>Business Productivity</a> concluded from a study by Schwarz that <q>32% of the individuals who used instant messaging in the office acknowledged that instant messaging could encourage workplace gossip, and 29% noted that instant messaging had been a distraction at some point in the past</q>. Another concern is that IM will lead to a decline in in-person relationships (<a href=resources.html#business>Business Productivity</a>). Additionally, it may contribute to rises in multitasking and grammatical issues within schools (<a href=resources.html#UK>UK Essays</a>). </p>
    <p>
      On the flipside, IM technology already has many benefits to society. In particular, it is seen as helpful for saving time and money, especially when it comes to communicating with business partners remotely (<a href=resources.html#business>Business Productivity</a>; <a href=resources.html#hutt>Hutt</a>; <a href=resources.html#scott>Scott</a>). </p>
      <p>
      In addition to social behavioral changes, IM has influenced laws that are needed to ensure safety. For example, laws have shifted to accommodate changes in communication. Within the United States, there are policies concerning IM that state <q>agencies that allow IM traffic on their networks must recognize that such content may be a Federal record</q> (<a href=resources.html#us>The U.S. National Archives Records Administration</a>). This means that law enforcement may be able to access any data collected by IM companies. In additional, company specific policies give IM servers access to user information; there are greater data collection opportunities. This increase in available data has contributed to an increase in research in disciplines such as Data Science and Media Studies. Furthermore, IM has been known to reach fields such as health care where doctors may transmit personal information of clients. Given the scope of IM, it makes sense that there have been pushes for increased security and openness from IM servicing companies about data breaches (<a href=resources.html#chair>Chari & Gane</a>).
