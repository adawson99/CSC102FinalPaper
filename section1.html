    In November of 1996, the first IM website called ICQ was formed. It has 850,000 users by July of the same year. IM has continued to grow since them. In 2015, the number of accounts on IM reached 3.2 billion accounts (The Radicati Group, Inc., 2015, p. 4). The number of IM servicers, and mediums for clients to access IM servers have increased as well. According to Statista, popular IM phone apps are WhatsApp, followed by Facebook Messenger, WeChat, QQ Mobile, and Skype (BirdsBeep, 2018). Other frequently used services include “Apple iMessage, Blackberry Messenger…, and Kik Interactive” (The Radicitati Group, Inc. 2015, p. 4).  There are many options for IM clients; these include web browsers, single-protocol and multi-protocol applications, enterprise IM, and portable IMs” (DeHoyos, 2018, para. 4). Single-protocol applications can only connect users on one network, whereas multi-protocol applications can connect users from multiple networks. Additionally, there is a greater number of mediums for using IM clients; mobile phones, Apple watches, tablets, and laptops have joined the ranks of desktop computers for IM usage.
As a result of how widespread and easily available IM has become, it is increasingly used in a wide variety of settings. This includes personal settings, academic settings, and the workplace (UK Essays, 2013). Personal usages include communications with friends or family members. In school, IM can be used on collaborative assignments and in class activities, such as polls. Furthermore, IM is present in the professional world through networking, interviewing, and collaborative assignments. The adoption of IM by businesses has contributed to the development of new norms for socialization and communication with colleagues (Giang, 2013; Frankola, 2015; Seid, 2014).
One group that benefits from the growth of the IM industry is developers. In general, developers are can reap a profit, gather information, and create jobs through IM technology. Although Statista (2011) stated that the profitability of IM technology is characterized by shrinking growth rates, IM is still a profitable industry for developers to be in. Additionally, availability of user’s information by IM networks may allow for mass data collection. This data can be used to target ads for individual clients. Finally, the IM industry creates software developer jobs; software developers may be responsible for maintaining IM technology through small or large IM servicing companies.
In recent years, IM developers have increased the ability of users to control their IM experience. In recent decades, there capabilities of IM clients has expanded. For instance, some more recently added capabilities of IM include file-sharing, user ability to “archive IM conversations”, “personal icons, screen interfaces, and greetings”; as well as “video-chat capabilities” (Copper & Tyson, New Instant Messaging Innovations, para. 1-2). These features are commonly expected to be capabilities of IM clients. However, many different IM protocols exists and they all have different underlying implementations. Aside from all these cool features, the general functionality of all IM networks includes user authentication with a network server, two-person instant messaging in real time, and the maintenance of contact or buddy lists.
To accomplish these tasks and functionality there is a general IM structure. [To learn more about this… click here].
